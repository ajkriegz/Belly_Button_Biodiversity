# Overview

This analysis was performed using Plotly, Boxplot, Leaflet, Javascript, and D3.

## Purpose

This project visualizes volunteer data of belly button environment bacteria. Many bacteria are unexplored, and there is potential for one of these bacteria to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.

This dashboard serves to aid in exploratory analysis of bacterial data for our volunteers. Specifically, volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species of belly button bacteria as a candidate for manufacturing synthetic beef, the volunteer will be able to identify if that species is found in their navel.
